I spend most of my time hanging out with my wife and my crazy golden retriever.

I like to build custom keyboards. I am currently working on a project that involves designing a custom case in CAD for an electro-capacitive (EC) PCB.

Recently I built a bot that monitors Shopify websites and sends notifications to Discord when inventory is re-stocked. The app is fully serverless on AWS (Lambda, DDB, etc.). The bot is actively being used by a community of about 20 people.

I like to read. I am currently reading Gene Wolfe's _Book of the New Sun_.

I also like to exercise; particularly running.
