I spend most of my time hanging out with my wife and my crazy golden retriever, Link. He loves to bark at invisible things and do zoomies around the yard.

I like keyboards. No, really. Check out [/r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://old.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/) or come say hi on the [ConicalKeyboards](https://conicalkeyboards.com/) Discord server. I have built several custom keyboards. I am currently working on a project that involves designing a custom case in CAD and commissioning it through a CNC manufacturing shop.

Occasionally, I also like to tackle personal coding projects. Lately, I have been working on a bot that monitors Shopify websites and notifies me via Discord when inventory is re-stocked. The app is fully serverless on AWS (Lambda, DDB, etc.). I also occasionally study and practice algo-trading on QuantConnect.

I like to read. I particularly enjoy works that heavily emphasize philosophy, such as Gene Wolfe's _Book of the New Sun_. Does this prove how smart I am?

I also like to exercise. I particularly enjoy running. I am not a marathoner or anything like that, but I try to run a 5K at least a few times per week. I also do some heavy lifting in the off-season. I squatted nearly 2x my body weight this year!

I like to snowboard when it gets cold, but nowadays I only make it to the slopes once or twice per season. So little time!
