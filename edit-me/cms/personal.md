NetDevOps turned SWE. Based on the North Shore of Boston.

As far as jobs go, I have worked the gamut; I started my career at the age of 20 on the Help Desk. From there, I worked
my way up to Field Engineer; to IT Systems Engineer; to DevOps Engineer; and finally, to Software Engineer.

I have also operated technology within many industries in the Greater Boston Area including SMBs, hospitals, and
colleges; mainly as a result of working for MSPs. However, I left MSP life and started working at my first corporate gig
in 2018.

Today, I work across multiple software engineering domains. A lot of TypeScript, Java, Python, and Docker in particular.
I do a lot of back end web development in particular.
