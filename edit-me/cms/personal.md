I am a jack-of-all-trades engineer with an active DoD secret clearance. I have an extensive background in IT Operations, network engineering, and DevOps. I have nearly a decade of technology experience, spread between MSPs, Corporate IT, and software engineering. Since completing my B.S. in computer science, I've primarily focused on backend web development (REST APIs & distributed services).
