I am a jack of all trades with an active DoD secret clearance. I have an extensive background in IT Operations, network engineering, and DevOps. I have almost 7 years of experience spread between working at MSPs and working for Corporate IT at MITRE. Since completing my B.S. in Computer Science last August (2021), I have been primarily focused on web development with a focus on back end distributed services.
