I am a jack of all trades engineer with an active DoD secret clearance. I have an extensive background in IT Operations, network engineering, and DevOps. I have nearly a decade of work experience working in technology spread between MSPs Corporate IT, and software engineering. Since completing my B.S. in Computer Science last August (2021), I have been primarily focused on web development with a focus on back-end distributed services.
