I currently work in the 'MITRE Labs' division as a software engineer. I have worked on the following projects since joining MITRE Labs in mid-2021:

#### MITRE ATT&CK©

- Develop and maintain software which supports the MITRE ATT&CK© cyber-security researchers and content creators.
- Provide software maintenance/support to various open-source projects listed under the [mitre-attack](https://github.com/mitre-attack) and [center-for-threat-informed-defense](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense) organizations on GitHub.
- Designed and implemented the [ATT&CK© Workbench TAXII Server](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server), a [TAXII 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/taxii-v2.1.html)–compliant REST API built with Nodejs and Docker.

#### Other Work

- Provide software engineering and DevOps expertise alongside ML experts to develop facial recognition software.
- Maintain and develop web service (Spring Boot and Angular) for facial recognition software.
- Refactor application from mono-repo monolith to a microservices poly-repo paradigm.
- Implement CI/CD to automatically build, publish, and deploy poly-repo modules.

#### MITRE Engineering Platform

- Briefly operated as a key stakeholder and task lead on an effort focused on developing internal enterprise tools.
- Had roughly 15 direct reports and laid the foundation for what would eventually become MITRE's internal 'Knowledge Sharing' platform.
