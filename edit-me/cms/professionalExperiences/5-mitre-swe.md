# Summary

I currently work in the 'MITRE Labs' division as a SWE. I have worked on the following projects since joining MITRE Labs in mid-2021:

### MITRE ATT&CK©

I develop and sustain the software which enables the MITRE ATT&CK© cyber-security researchers and content creators to do their work. I designed and implemented the [ATT&CK© Workbench TAXII Server](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-workbench-taxii-server), which is a [TAXII 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/taxii-v2.1.html)–compliant REST API built with Nodejs and Docker. It was designed to sunset the legacy TAXII server which was built on the older [TAXII 2.0](http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.0/taxii-v2.0.html) specification. I provide software maintenance/support to various open-source projects listed under the [mitre-attack](https://github.com/mitre-attack) and [center-for-threat-informed-defense](https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense) organizations on GitHub.

I designed and implemented the ATT&CK Workbench TAXII 2.1 server as part of an effort to sunset the legacy TAXII 2.0 server. I provide software maintenance/support to all open source repositories listed under the `mitre-attack` and `center-for-threat-informed-defense` organizations on GitHub.

## Other Work

I provide SWE and DevOps expertise and work alongside ML experts to develop facial recognition software. The app spans many languages and frameworks, _e.g._, Spring Boot and Angular on the presentation layer; Python (PyTorch), Java (TensorFlow), and C++ in the service layer; MySQL, MongoDB, and Docker volumes for data persistence. It is a microservices architecture encapsulated in Docker Compose.

## MITRE Engineering Platform

I briefly operated as a key stakeholder and task lead on an effort focused on developing internal enterprise tools. I had roughly 15 direct reports and laid the foundation for what would eventually become MITRE's internal 'Knowledge Sharing' platform.
