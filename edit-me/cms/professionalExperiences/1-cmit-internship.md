Right around the time that my internship was converted to a full-time staff position, CMIT Solutions of Boston merged with another MSP; the resultant company was called Apogee IT Solutions.

### Responsibilities:

- Assisted senior engineers with network & infrastructure integration projects via equipment preparation & after-hours rack-and-stacking exercises.
- Created standardized procedures for client-specific endpoint configurations, and created 30-page SOP for internal NOC. Partook in subsequent eyes-on-glass initiative to grapple failed backup jobs & stagnating NOC alerts.
- Worked in the Help Desk support queue in a fast-paced environment to resolve tier 1-2 issues.
