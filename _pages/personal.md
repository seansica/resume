# description: A few personal notes outside of work.
---

I live on the Boston north shore. I am a husband, dog dad, casual philosophy buff, Gene Wolfe aficionado, lifter, and runner. I have a weird obsession with custom, electrocapacitive keyboards, and recently got into photography. I am enthralled by AI safety and aspire to make the world a better place.
